Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

- This app was created by @aleezuck, @stephosj07 and @monkz11 with the goal of simplifying the process of getting a plant
- In essence what bloom does is give you a selected list of plants based on your specific search criteria about price, light level, care level and if you have pets or children
- Once you have found your plant bloom provides more detailed descriptions, more pictures, detailed information on how to care for the plant and a forum for the community to talk and give eachother advise regarding this plant
- If you want to buy said plant bloom gives you plant stores near your location as well as online stores that have your plant in their inventory, one click away from purchase
